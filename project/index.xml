      <description>Introduction The data for this project was pulled from the County Health Rankings website. For each county, I looked at two factors.
First, I observed the verage grade level performance for 3rd graders on math standardized tests. This is the data set called “math”. If the third graders score a 3, they are performing at grade level. A score of 3.5 indicates that on average, the kids in that county are, on average, performing half a grade level better than expected for third graders.</description>
